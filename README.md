Sri Kachabesvara Temple is an ancient Hindu temple located in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, 
dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple derives its name from the legend of Lord Vishnu worshipping Shiva 
here in the form of a tortoise (Kurma avatar), hence the name Kachabeshwara (Kachapa meaning tortoise).
The temple is known for its beautiful Dravidian-style architecture, intricately carved pillars, and peaceful atmosphere.
 Within the complex, devotees can find shrines for Lord Shiva, Goddess Parvati, and other deities. The temple holds great religious significance, as it represents 
 the harmony between Shaivism and Vaishnavismâ€”highlighting the story where even Vishnu himself offered prayers to Shiva.
